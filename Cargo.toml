# The NEON implementation does not participate in dynamic feature detection,
# which is currently x86-only. If "neon" is on, NEON support is assumed. Note
# that AArch64 always supports NEON, but support on ARMv7 varies. The NEON
# implementation uses C intrinsics and requires a C compiler.
neon = []

# This crate uses libstd for std::io trait implementations, and also for
# runtime CPU feature detection. This feature is enabled by default. If you use
# --no-default-features, the only way to use the SIMD implementations in this
# crate is to enable the corresponding instruction sets statically for the
# entire build, with e.g. RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native".
std = ["digest/std"]

# The "rayon" feature (defined below as an optional dependency) enables the
# `Hasher::update_rayon` method, for multithreaded hashing. However, even if
# this feature is enabled, all other APIs remain single-threaded.

# This crate implements traits from the RustCrypto project, exposed here as the
# "traits-preview" feature. However, these traits aren't stable, and they're
# expected to change in incompatible ways before they reach 1.0. For that
# reason, this crate makes no SemVer guarantees for this feature, and callers
# who use it should expect breaking changes between patch versions of this
# crate. (The "*-preview" feature name follows the conventions of the RustCrypto
# "signature" crate.)
traits-preview = ["digest"]

# ---------- Features below this line are for internal testing only. ----------

# By default on x86_64, this crate uses Samuel Neves' hand-written assembly
# implementations for SSE4.1, AVX2, and AVX512. (These provide both the best
# runtime performance, and the fastest build times.) And by default on 32-bit
# x86, this crate uses Rust intrinsics implementations for SSE4.1 and AVX2, and
# a C intrinsics implementation for AVX-512. In both cases, if a C compiler is
# not detected, or if AVX-512 support is missing from the detected compiler,
# build.rs automatically falls back to a pure Rust build. This feature forces
# that fallback, for testing purposes. (Note that in CI testing, we set the
# BLAKE3_CI environment variable, which instructs build.rs to error out rather
# than doing an automatic fallback.)
pure = []

# As described above, on x86_64 this crate use assembly implementations by
# default. Enabling the "prefer_intrinsics" feature makes this crate use
# intrinsics implementations on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86, again for testing
# purposes.
prefer_intrinsics = []

# Disable individual instruction sets. CI testing uses these flags to simulate
# different levels of hardware SIMD support. Note that code for the
# corresponding instruction set is still compiled; only detection is disabled.
#
# As noted above, these flags are *for testing only* and are not stable. It's
# possible that some users might find that their particular use case performs
# better if e.g. AVX-512 is disabled, because of issues like CPU downlocking.
# If that comes up, and if disabling the instruction set here at the feature
# level turns out to be the right approach, then we can design a stable
# feature. Until then, we reserve the right to break these features in a patch
# release.
