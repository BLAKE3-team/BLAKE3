# Like SSE4.1 and AVX2, the AVX-512 implementation participates in dynamic CPU
# feature detection. A binary with "c_avx512" on is still cross-platform. This
# feature has no effect on non-x86.

# The NEON implementation does not participate in dynamic feature detection,
# which is currently x86-only. If "c_neon" is on, NEON support is assumed. Note
# that AArch64 always supports NEON, but support on ARMv7 varies.

# A performance note for the "rayon" feature: Multi-threading can have
# significant overhead for small inputs, particularly on x86 where individual
# cores are very fast. On the other hand, on slower platforms like ARM,
# multi-threading can be beneficial for all inputs. There's no one input size
# threshold that would work well everywhere, and this crate doesn't try to be
# clever. If you're going to enable the "rayon" feature, you should benchmark
# it for your specific use case.
