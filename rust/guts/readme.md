# `blake3_guts`

This crate contains low-level, high-performance, platform-specific
implementations of the BLAKE3 compression function. This API is complicated and
unsafe, and this crate will never have a stable release. For the standard
BLAKE3 hash function, see the [`blake3`](https://crates.io/crates/blake3)
crate, which depends on this one.
