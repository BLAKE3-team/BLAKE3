# This hacky script works around the fact that `cross test` does not support
# path dependencies. (It uses a docker shared folder to let the guest access
# project files, so parent directories aren't available.) Solve this problem by
# copying the entire project to a temp dir and rearranging paths to put
# "blake3" and "reference_impl" underneath "test_vectors", so that everything
# is accessible. Hopefully this will just run on CI forever and no one will
# ever read this and discover my deep shame.
